NAME
    Data::Serializable - Moose role that adds serialization support to any
    class

VERSION
    version 0.40.0

SYNOPSIS
        package MyClass;
        use Moose;
        with 'Data::Serializable';
        no Moose;

        package main;
        my $obj = MyClass->new( serializer_module => 'JSON' );
        my $json = $obj->serialize( "Foo" );
        ...
        my $str = $obj->deserialize( $json );

DESCRIPTION
    A Moose-based role that enables the consumer to easily
    serialize/deserialize data structures. The default serializer is
    Storable, but any serializer in the Data::Serializer hierarchy can be
    used automatically. You can even install your own custom serializer if
    the pre-defined ones are not useful for you.

ATTRIBUTES
  throws_exception
    Defines if methods should throw exceptions or return undef. Default is
    to throw exceptions. Override default value like this:

        has '+throws_expection' => ( default => 0 );

  serializer_module
    Name of a predefined module that you wish to use for serialization. Any
    submodule of Data::Serializer is automatically supported. The built-in
    support for Storable doesn't require Data::Serializer.

  serializer
    If none of the predefined serializers work for you, you can install your
    own. This should be a code reference that takes one argument (the
    message to encode) and returns a scalar back to the caller with the
    serialized data.

  deserializer
    Same as serializer, but to decode the data.

METHODS
  serialize($message)
    Runs the serializer on the specified argument.

  deserialize($message)
    Runs the deserializer on the specified argument.
